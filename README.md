# OTT_Dashboard

This project involves creating an interactive and insightful dashboard for analyzing OTT platform data. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of user engagement, content performance, subscription trends, and other key metrics. It allows users to:

1. Visualize data using interactive charts and graphs.
2. Analyze viewership trends across genres, regions, and time.
3. Monitor subscription patterns and churn rates.
4. Identify top-performing shows and movies.
5. Gain actionable insights for decision-making.

Let's understand the project using STAR strategy---

**Situation (S):**

With the growing demand for OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms, streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Hotstar have gained massive user bases. The industry is evolving rapidly with shifts in subscription trends, content preferences, and user engagement.
Companies in this space need data-driven insights to understand:

1. Which genres attract the most viewers?
2. What factors drive user engagement and subscriptions?
3. How do different OTT platforms perform in terms of revenue, content diversity, and user retention?

**Task (T):**

The objective of this project was to analyze and visualize key OTT platform trends using data analytics. The focus areas included:

1. Content analysis: Popular genres, movie ratings, and content availability across platforms.
2. User engagement: Monthly active users, watch hours, and churn rate.
3. Revenue trends: Subscription-based vs. ad-based revenue models.

**Action (A):**

To conduct the analysis, the following steps were taken:

**Data Collection & Cleaning:**

* Gathered data from sources like Kaggle, IMDb, etc.
* Cleaned the dataset to remove missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Used Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI for data visualization.
* Identified key metrics: average ratings, content distribution, genre popularity, and user retention rates.

**Insights from Analysis:**

* Content Distribution: Netflix and Amazon Prime had the largest content libraries, but Disney+ Hotstar had more regional content.

**Genre Popularity:**

* Drama (35%) and Comedy (25%) were the most-watched genres.
* Sci-fi and Horror had the lowest engagement (~5%).

**User Retention & Churn Rate:**

* Netflix had the highest retention rate (~78%) due to strong personalized recommendations.
* Disney+ Hotstar showed seasonal spikes in user engagement due to sports events (IPL, FIFA).

**Revenue Insights:**

* Subscription-based models (like Netflix) generated 70% of revenue.
* Ad-supported models (like YouTube, Hotstar) had a lower revenue per user but a wider audience base.

**Dashboard Creation (Power BI):**

* Created an interactive dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
* Top-performing OTT platforms based on user engagement.
* Trend analysis of viewership over time.

**Result (R):**

The project provided valuable insights into OTT industry trends:

* ✅ Helped identify which platforms are leading in terms of content diversity and engagement. 
* ✅ Showed that personalization (Netflix’s algorithm) improves user retention. 
* ✅ Highlighted that regional content (Disney+ Hotstar) is crucial for audience engagement. 
* ✅ Provided a visual, data-driven summary for decision-makers to optimize content strategies.
